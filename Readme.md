# Reporting for WinForms - How to Print a Report on a Dot Matrix Printer


This example shows how to print a report on a dot matrix printer. First, the report is exported to CSV format and saved to a temporary file in the current application directory. Then the [Process.Start](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process.start) method initiates the printing process. In this example, the verb "Print" is assigned to the `ProcessStartInfo.Verb` property of the [ProcessStartInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.processstartinfo) instance passed to the [Process.Start](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process.start) method.
